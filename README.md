# angular-select-tag
Angular Select Tag with Search. Can Handle upto 3000+ options, async data loads and chained selections.

I optimized the ui-select from the base repos below to work for 3000+ options. If you need a more feature rich version of select please go to the below repos and find it. 

This select.js is lean and optimized to handle more records and removed all complex UI elemets to have better performance.

I selected this because of below reasons.

* chained aysnc data calls works perfectly.
* Can handle 3000+ options.
* Search was awesome.
* Keyboard Support.
* Easy to Implement.
* Works well with Angular.
